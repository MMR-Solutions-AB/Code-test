### Introduction:
Thank you for taking the time doing this code test. 

The test is divided into three steps. Try to complete each step before proceeding to the next one. Note, we only want you to submit on project not three separate ones. Submit you code with the solution that you are satisfied with.


### Useful Documentation:
* MeteorJS
* BlazeJS
* SpacebarsJS

### Where to implement your solutions:

** Please note that you do not need to create ANY new files to solve any of the following assignments. If you really want to, you may, but it should not be needed. **

### Three Assignments:
1. Use the json object from the file data.js. Parse it and display cards for each object in the json. We want you to display the name of the color and a sample of the color. In other words, display the color name and the color. For the cards, you will find a template named card.html. Use this template when displaying the cards. 

2. Once you have completed step one, instead of displaying all the colors in the data.js file, randomly display 5 unique colors. For this step it is okay to use the page refresh to generate new random cards. make sure the cards are unique and that the program never crashes because of your “random” algorithm. 

3. Finally. implement some type of form where you can select how many random cards to display on the screen (within the bounds of the data.js objects length). The page should show these cards without the page refreshing. 

(4). If have spare time and would like to impress us, make sure that the page is responsive for phones.
