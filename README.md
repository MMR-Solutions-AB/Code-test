### Where to implement your solutions:


** Please note that you do not need to create ANY new files to solve any of the following assignments. If you really want to, you may, but it should not be needed. **

### Three Assignments:
1. Use the json object called "Movies". Loop through all items and display them on the screen. Each "movie" should be a card that looks like card.html.

2. Now, instead display only 5 of the "movies" and randomly only show 5 of the movies, instead of all of them.

3. Implement a form where you can select how many random cards should be displayed. Add a button that instantly, without refresh, displays the number movies on the screen.

(4). If have spare time and would like to impress us, make sure that the page is responsive for phones.
